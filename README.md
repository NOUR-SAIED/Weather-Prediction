# Weather-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether it will rain tomorrow using the WeatherAUS dataset from Kaggle. The main goal is to apply machine learning techniques to classify the target variable RainTomorrow based on various weather features such as temperature, humidity, wind, and more.

## Key Features:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized feature distributions and correlations to gain insights.
- Modeling: Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curves.
## Files:
- Weather_Prediction.ipynb: Main notebook containing all steps from EDA to model evaluation.
## Tools & Libraries:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
